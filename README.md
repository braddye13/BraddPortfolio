# BraddPortfolio 
This project focuses on practicing MIPS assembly programming by implementing two algorithms: selection sort and recursive summation. The main goal is to create a program called avgScore.s, which asks the user for assignment scores, 
sorts them in descending order using selection sort, and then calculates the average score after removing a specified number of the lowest scores. The project requires implementing three functions: printArray, selSort, and calcSum, 
with calcSum needing to be recursive.
