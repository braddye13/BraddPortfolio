# Assembly Language
This project focuses on practicing MIPS assembly programming by implementing two algorithms: selection sort and recursive summation. The main goal is to create a program called avgScore.s, which asks the user for assignment scores, 
sorts them in descending order using selection sort, and then calculates the average score after removing a specified number of the lowest scores. The project requires implementing three functions: printArray, selSort, and calcSum, 
with calcSum needing to be recursive. 

The program reads a puzzle grid from a text file and searches for a user-specified word within the grid in a case-insensitive manner and all eight directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal). 
The search path of the found word is displayed using step numbers that indicate the order in which letters are located. The project emphasizes fundamental C programming concepts such as 2D dynamic arrays, pointers,
and string manipulation without using array notation or standard library case conversion functions
